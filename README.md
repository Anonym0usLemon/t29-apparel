# Description

This is a single page eCommerce application built for T29 Apparel using React. 

`./src/App` houses the code for the header, nav, and footer. The main content is imported from `./src/components` using the `react-router-dom` library. 


# TODO List:

1. Finish adding content for other pages listed in the nav. 
2. Replace image under the header with an image slideshow. 
3. Implement a contact form for customers to request special orders. 
4. Implement a method for customers to sign up for adverts/promotions using the form in the footer.
5. refactor code to use css modules and styled components to avoid CSS collisions
